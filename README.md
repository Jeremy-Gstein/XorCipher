# XorCipher
A basic python program that takes a plaintext message and converts each letter, number, and symbol 
to its ASCII decimal then that gets converted to a binary number where it finally gets XOR with a randomly generated key. 

NOTE XOR is not sufficient encryption!

My python and programming skills are very raw. I hope to add improvements and optimizations to this code as I progress my learning or review feedback.
