# XorCipher
A basic python program that takes a plaintext message and converts each letter, number, and symbol 
to its ASCII decimal then that gets converted to a binary number where it finally gets XOR with a randomly generated key. 

NOTE XOR is not sufficient encryption!

Thanks for checking out the Repo!
